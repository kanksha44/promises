# promises

#Promise: Imagine you ask your friend to bring you some ice cream. You don't know how long it will take, but your friend promises to bring it. A promise in JavaScript is similar. It's like saying, "I'll do something, and when I'm done, I'll let you know."

#Promise.prototype.then(): This method is like saying, "When my friend brings the ice cream, I'll eat it." In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```

#Promise.prototype.catch(): If your friend tells you they couldn't bring the ice cream, you might say, "Oh well, I'll just have something else." In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
promise.catch(onRejected);
```

#Promise.prototype.finally(): Whether your friend brings the ice cream or not, you might say, "Thanks for trying!" In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
promise.finally(onFinally);
```

#Promise.resolve(): Imagine if your friend suddenly says, "Hey, I have ice cream right now!" That's like resolving a promise immediately. In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
const promise = Promise.resolve(value);
```

#Promise.reject(): If your friend says, "Sorry, the ice cream shop is closed," that's like rejecting a promise. In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
const promise = Promise.reject(reason);
```

#Promise.all(): Imagine you ask three friends to bring you different flavors of ice cream. You tell them, "I'll wait until all of you come back before I eat." In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(values => {
    // All promises are resolved
    console.log(values);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // If any promise is rejected
    console.error(error);
  });
```

#Promise.race(): Imagine you ask two friends to bring you ice cream, but you only need one. You'll eat whichever comes first. In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
  .then(value => {
    // The first promise to resolve
    console.log(value);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // If any promise is rejected
    console.error(error);
  });
```

#Promise.allSettled(): Imagine you ask three friends to bring you ice cream, but you don't care if some of them fail. You just want to know the result of each. In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(results => {
    // Array of results for each promise
    console.log(results);
  });
```

#Promise.any(): Imagine you ask three friends to bring you ice cream, but you only need one of them to succeed. In code, it looks like this:

```javascript
Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(value => {
    // The first promise to fulfill
    console.log(value);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // If all promises are rejected
    console.error(error);
  });
```

#Promise.withResolvers(): This one isn't a standard method, but it's like saying, "I'll make you a promise, and I'll decide when it's resolved or rejected." It's a bit more advanced, but you might see it used with libraries or frameworks.

These examples should help you understand promises better, just like waiting for ice cream from your friends!
